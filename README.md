# biodiversity-1

For this project I was a biodiversity analyst working for the National Parks Service. I was helping them analyse some data about species at various national parks.
I was given 2 CSV files data about different species in our National Parks, including:

•	The scientific name of each species
•	The common names of each species
•	The species conservation status

I used Pandas to manipulate and reorganise the data and to find the amount of species for each conservation status to further visualise it with Matplotlib. 
   
 
From my finding we can see that the amount of endangered species equals to 3.3%.
To find if certain types of species are more likely to be endangered, I continued to reorganise datasets with Pandas (regrouped certain columns and pivoted and renamed them). 
 
It looked like species in category Mammal are more likely to be endangered than species in Bird. I run a chi squared test which did not confirm this statement.
I run this test few more times and found that species in category Reptile are more in danger compared to Mammal.
 
Then I merged 2 CSV files, used different functions of Python to reorganise the datasets and Seaborn to visualise my findings. 

 
Then I was calculating the sample size for further hypothesis tests which could be conducted with these results.
